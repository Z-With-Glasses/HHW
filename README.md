This project was made to show my progress in learning C++ from learncpp.com. Any reference to lessons are from that site, though the lesson numbers may have changed as the site is updated over time.

Proj23 is the most interesting and also  made completely outside of learncpp's lesson plan. It demonstrates the Monty Hall Problem in either an automatic mode or manual.

All of the projects were originally written to output only to console but for this program I used WxWidgets to add a GUI.
The original code is shown in the GUI but can also be found in HelloWorld.exe.
